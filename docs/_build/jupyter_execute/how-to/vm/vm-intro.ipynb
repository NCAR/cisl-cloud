Right now the process to get a VM is to submit a ticket with the NCAR/UCAR Service Desk [here](https://ithelp.ucar.edu/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/create/17). In your request please provide the number of CPUs, amount of memory (GB), required disk size (GB), and the operating system you want to run. If you have any other special requests or requirements please provide them here. "
