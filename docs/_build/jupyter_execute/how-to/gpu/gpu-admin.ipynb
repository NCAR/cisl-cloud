    "In order to connect JupyterHub singleuser environments to GPUs the nvidia runtime class needs to be set as the default for the container. Changing the default runtime for the cluster will cause issues and can bring the whole cluster down by interrupting other pods like the CNIs (Container Network Interface). This can be accomplished by providing an [extra_pod_config](https://jupyterhub-kubespawner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spawner.html#kubespawner.KubeSpawner.extra_pod_config) in the helm chart configuration for the GPU singleuser image. This isn't 100% clear in the documentation and where to place this isn't clear either. An example of what this looks like in the values used for the Helm install is as follows:"
