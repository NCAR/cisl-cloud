You should have a dedicated namespace to deploy your applications to. If you do not have a dedicated namespace see the creating a namespace documentation [here](../Rancher/create-namespace.ipynb). The second is the `name:` field. This is where you define a unique and descriptive name for your Deployment. The third is the `image:` field and it's where you select the image to use in your deployment. The image will be pulled from Docker Hub by default but a different repository can be provided. The final field is the `containerPort:` field. This is very important to make sure the correct port to access the application is exposed to k8s for access. You typically can set this to a specific port in your applications settings, or use the default port opened by the application that is running your web service. If you are unsure what this is, typically you will see it in the output when you run your service locally i.e. `http://localhost:5001`. In this case 5001 is the `containerPort:` to expose. "

    "There's important fields to call out in the Ingress manifest as well. To start the `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer:` is very important to make sure your application gets a valid certificate. This carries down to the `tls:` section and the `secretName:` field. The `secretName:` should be unique for the `hosts:` FQDN specified. If you are using the same FQDN with different prefixes the `secretName:` should be the one used for the initial certificate issue for the FQDN requested. Speaking of `hosts:` this is defined in two places, under `tls:` and `rules:`. The hostname used should be unique and has to be under the `*.k8s.ucar.edu` domain. The k8s cluster utilizes ExternalDNS to create new DNS records for the hostname provided and it is configured to only deploy under `*.k8s.ucar.edu`. The certificates that are issued are also only valid for FQDN's in `*.k8s.ucar.edu`. The final piece that is important to call out is the `port:` field. This should be the same in the Deployment, Service, and Ingress configuration.  "
