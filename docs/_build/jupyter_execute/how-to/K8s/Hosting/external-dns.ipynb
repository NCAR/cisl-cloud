    "Our Kubernetes cluster utilizes the [ExternalDNS by Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/stack/external-dns/helm) Helm chart to create new DNS host records for Ingress objects assigned to applications. This allows users to provide hostnames in the `*.k8s.ucar.edu` domain in their Ingress configuration. ExternalDNS will then go ahead and create an associated A record in DNS so the hostname and subsequent URL are resolvable. This is coupled with [cert-manager](cert-mgr.ipynb) and the [Ingress Controller](ingress.ipynb) to provide a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and URL that are reachable over HTTPS with valid TLS certs.

Couple this with the Bitnami Helm chart installation documentation [here](https://bitnami.com/stack/external-dns/helm) to get this up and running on our cluster. "
