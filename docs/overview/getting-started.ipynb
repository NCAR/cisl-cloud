Microservices are utilized to provide a tool set that streamlines common tasks. Examples of common tasks that are eliminated due to these microservices are creating DNS records, assigning TLS certificates, configuring a reverse proxy, load balancing applications, scaling resources, mounting shared volumes, and providing a self healing environment that is highly available.
