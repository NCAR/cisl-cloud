    "Right now we are still determining the best way to allow users to deploy their applications. If you have a containerized version of your application and want to host it on the CISL cloud currently the best way to accomplish this is by [submitting a ticket](../../create-tickets) to the CISL Cloud Pilot team. We have a few methods identified on deploying with [kubectl](../Hosting/web-kubectl) and with [Helm](../Hosting/web-helm) but as of right now they require a few permissions that only administrators of the cloud have. This will change and a user friendly method to deploy these applications will be identified and documented for the user base."
