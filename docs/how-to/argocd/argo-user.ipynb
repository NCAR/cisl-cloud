    "We have an instance of [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) installed to help us handle Continuous Delivery (CD). What this ultimately means is if your applications Git repo is setup in Argo CD it can be automatically configured tp deploy any changes made to that repository without any intervention by the user or admins. This allows users to deploy their applications automatically to k8s without having to worry about interacting directly with Kubernetes. If you are looking for more information on how to start creating an application to host on k8s please look at the documentation [here](https://ncar.github.io/cisl-cloud/how-to/K8s/Hosting/web-intro.html)."
