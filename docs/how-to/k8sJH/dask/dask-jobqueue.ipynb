    "[Dask-Jobqueue](https://jobqueue.dask.org/en/latest/) is a Python module that enables an easy way to deploy Dask clusters on HPC job queueing systems like PBS, Slurm, MOAB, SGE, LSF, and HTCondor. An example on how to use `dask_jobqueue` to provision a Dask cluster on a PBS scheduler can be seen below:"

    "The Dask-Jobqueue documentation [here](https://jobqueue.dask.org/en/latest/configuration-setup.html) provides a much greater in depth explanation of each of these values and how to customize them appropriately. There is also a YouTube video on the CISL YouTube channel called \"Using Dask on HPC Systems\" that is very informative. The beginning of part 2 goes over dask_jobqueue on NCAR HPC resources and can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4utSzWgJEo) \n"
