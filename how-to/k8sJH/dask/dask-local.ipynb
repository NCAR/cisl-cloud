    "In Python you can utilize dask to create a cluster for parallel processing that shares resources with the system the code is running on. [LocalCluster](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/deploying-python.html#localcluster) is the best way to get started using Dask. It allows time to understand the different components involved in implementing parallel computing. Python's standard interpreter, CPython, is single threaded and only runs on a single CPU core. Your computer likely has multiple CPU cores available and tools like Dask LocalCluster can be used to take advantage of more CPU cores. By starting here you will understand when LocalCluster is no longer enough and more resources are required to scale your application or analysis. An example of how to accomplish this in your Python code can be seen below:"
