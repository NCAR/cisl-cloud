# Create tickets

The team utilizes Jira software to create tickets that then follow our [Kanban workflow](https://ncar.github.io/cisl-cloud/how-to/agile.html#kanban-board). 

```{note}
An Error may occur if you are not logged in or don't have the proper permissions. Click the link to login and you should be redirected back to the Create Issue page automatically. We try to allow any user the ability to create tickets but if you don't have proper permissions create a ticket [here](https://ithelp.ucar.edu/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/create/17) and a Jira administrator will grant access to the CCPP project.  
```

## Request New Services

If you have a request for a new service, or want to deploy a new application, there is a <a href="https://jira.ucar.edu/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=18470&issuetype=10903&customfield_10281=CCPP-108">link for New Request</a> on the top of this page that will take you to a page that looks like this:
