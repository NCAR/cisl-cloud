    "There are a number of different ways to create a containerized version of an application. Some popular versions of container formats are Docker, Podman, and Singularity to name a few. Podman and Singularity are known as being more secure options because end users do not have access to elevated privileges that can introduce vulnerable access points. With that being said this document is going to walk through building a Docker container as it's still the most popular option and is straightforward. The concepts covered in the walkthrough can be applied directly to Podman and Singularity."
