    "Go to the GitHub repository hosted at github.com and select Settings on the right side of the navbar at the top of the page. Once in Settings on the left side select Branches under Code and automation. By default there is no protection on any branches. Click on the box to `Add branch protection rule`. This will bring up a checklist for the different rules that can be applied to different branches. To start enter the branch name that should be protected in the `Branch name pattern *` textbox, in most cases this will be the `main` branch but additional branches can always be added and protected. To start select the box next to `Require a pull request before merging`, this will then open another box that's automatically selected to `Require approvals`. This is to setup the code review to approve pull requests and the approval number is set to 1 by default, but can be set to whatever makes sense. The only other option that needs to be selected is `Do not allow bypassing the above settings`. Click on the create button at the bottom and the main branch of the GitHub repository is now protected from having direct pushes made to it, and will only allows approved pull requests to be merged.

    "With the changes pushed the branches will now be out of sync. There are a few different ways to create a pull request to merge the changes. The easiest is to utilize the UI found at the repository on GitHub. On the top navigation bar there is a tab for `Pull requests`. From here you can chose branches to compare, confirm the changes you want to try and merge, add in a description for the changes, and ultimately submit the pull request. Once the PR is made an email will go out to approvers to review the request. Once it get's one review and approval the PR can be selected to Merge in to the main branch. As long as there are no conflicts the merge should proceed with no issues. If there are conflicts they should be handled via the code review, updated accordingly, agreed upon, and confirmed with another team member.  "
