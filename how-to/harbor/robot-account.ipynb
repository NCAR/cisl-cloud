    "After logging in to the Harbor UI, [https://hub.k8s.ucar.edu/](https://hub.k8s.ucar.edu/), with CIT credentials click on the project name listed where the robot account should be added. Once in the project there are several tabs for project settings including one named Robot Accounts. Select this tab to navigate to the Robot Accounts settings and click the button that says + NEW ROBOT ACCOUNT. This brings up a new window where the robot account can be named, the final account name will be robot-{Name}+{Name}, Expiration time, Description, and Permissions. Best practice is to set an Expiration time and not use the never expire option. Once created the only time the password, or secret, will be displayed pops up. Copy this now and store it in a safe location where it is not exposed in plain text publicly. A new secret can be generated by selecting the robot account and using the ACTION dropdown and the REFRESH SECRET option. "
